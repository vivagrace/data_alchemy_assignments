    "Here are the conceps you should brush-up on or learn to have a basic understanding of SQL and complete the assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic SQL Queries**  \n",
    "   - Understanding the `SELECT` statement, filtering with `WHERE`, and limiting results with `LIMIT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sorting and Aggregation**  \n",
    "   - Using `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` clauses and aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Joins and Relationships**  \n",
    "   - Combining data from multiple tables using various joins (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, self-joins).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Subqueries and Nested Queries**  \n",
    "   - Writing queries within queries to filter or compute intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  \n",
    "   - Creating temporary result sets to simplify complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Window Functions**  \n",
    "   - Applying functions across a set of rows related to the current row (e.g., `RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Transactions and Data Manipulation**  \n",
    "   - Using `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, and managing transactions with commands like `BEGIN` and `COMMIT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **String Aggregation**  \n",
    "   - Techniques to combine multiple row values into a single string (e.g., using `GROUP_CONCAT`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "I find the best way to learn is to start with looking up a specific concept and then playing around with it using an actual database (can use the Open Flights DB below). It can be also be helpful to use these interactive SQL learning tools:\n",
