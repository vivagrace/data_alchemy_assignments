    "\n",
    "The most important thing to do is define your problem statement (with your partner). This will be your nexus and will help you choose the dataset. Ideally this is the problem that you work on for the rest of the project. Since this is a big decision, you can change the problem statement and the dataset in the next assignment but no changes after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to look for a dataset\n",
    "There are too many sources for me to name all of them. **Kaggle** is the most popular. To search you can just use google or **Google Dataset Search** specifically. A lot of universities have their datasets available, like the one I use in my example below, which can be a great resource too. \n",

    "### EDA Study\n",
    "Here are some mandatory material to help you get a basic understanding:\n",
    "- https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/07/step-by-step-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-using-python/\n",
    "- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m4n2xVzk9o\n",
    "\n",
    "The sky is the limit with EDA, use this as a starting point and I expect you to go beyond. For instance I personally love this free book https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/ that dives deep into data science with python. <br>\n",
    "This book is entirely in jupyter notebooks for even more code examples: https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with partners\n",
    "To reiterate, you will decide the problem statement and the dataset together with you partner(s). I encourage you to work on the assignments together, disucss analytical processes and insights. If you are more experienced/knowledgable than your partner, please take the lead and help them understand any difficult concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The idea is to foster collaboration and get support on the path to self-suffciency.**<br>\n",
    "This means your assignment submissions, your final analyses and dashboard has to be completely your own. You should work on those independently. <br>\n",
    "For example, discussing a specific assignent task is okay but copying your partners answers is not. Attempt to understand from them and write what you know so when I give my feedback it is valuable."
